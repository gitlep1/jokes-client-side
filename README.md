APP DESCRIPTION:
  With this web app you can view jokes and create your own jokes!

LIST OF TECHNOLOGIES USED:

  *HTML

  *SCSS

  *JAVASCRIPT

  *API

  *HEROKU

  *GITHUB

  *MONGODB

PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT STORY:
  In order to plan out how I would create this jokes web app I came up with 2 wireframes one for the outer webapp (the first thing the users will see) and the other for the inner webapp (the thing users will see when they login).
  After that was done I started with the HTML and CSS (since those were the easiest). After I had my webapp's content and design completed I started working on the JAVASCRIPT stuff (it was actually alot easier to do then I thought it would be).
  Once I was done with that I deployed the client.

UNSOLVED ISSUES:
  *Doesn't have a way to choose a random joke.

  *Wanted the current joke to fade out after you clicked "Next Joke" then the new joke would fade in that way you wouldn't see them all at once.

  *Wanted to have a way for a newly created joke to be added to the correct section so whenever that user logs in again they can view their created joke.

  *Background images 'flicker' after they fully load in.

  *Wanted the create, update, delete and show a joke to open up a secondary form next to them where you would type in the text.

  *Wanted a way for users to vote on the best created jokes then that joke would be added to the offcial site for everyone to see and laugh at.

  *Eventually I want 4000+ jokes.
